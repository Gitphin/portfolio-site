# Portfolio Site
This portfolio site was a challenge to learn CSS and React concepts, and to do so by learning from scratch. I made this website without following any tutorials, and as a non-frontend dev I am pretty proud with how it turned out in the end. I wanted to make this website first as a challenge, but eventually found it pretty fun (and frusturating when picking the right colors sometimes). I will keep this updated from time to time, and hopefully it will be a useful resource later on!
